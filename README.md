# Deliverist marketing site

## todo

### issues:

 * no www

### day 2

 * choose better colors/ photo matches
 * think about going helvetica light black on white like my deliverist deck?
 * large images that look a bit small in responsive mode
 * when no network - takes ages to load - which means we have a blocking external network request - get rid of it!
 * same card heights?
 * cookies notice
 * add google tracking
 * add google font but ony with no "wait for text" problems
 * new photo for find us - outside navigation
 * make photos opaque
 * new parallax js - materialize forces opaque style back?!
 * fix icon fallback to be empty image instead of words?
 * lighthouse testing and improvements
